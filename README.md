This project is our inaugural analysis, designed to evaluate the performance of four companies within the commercial sector over a three-year period, from 2021 to 2023, segmented by quarters. The database used in this analysis is entirely hypothetical and does not reflect actual figures or pertain to any real-world companies. Click the Analyzing_The_Performance_P1.ipynb.
**Alternatively**, you can access the project files directly, which are located in the Data File and include all necessary documents and data. The guidelines are provided in the "README First.PDF" and "Conclusions.PDF" files. You may choose to review the project in either format.
